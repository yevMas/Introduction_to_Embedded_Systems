# Introduction_to_Embedded_Systems
Hello everyone! 

I recently finished the coursera "Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments", 
and in this repo you will find all the activities pf the course.

I did the free version of the course (the difference between the paying version is the revision of 
the activities), so it was kind of difficult to do all the activities with almost no guidance.

So if you are doing the course and you need some help, please feel free to use this Repo.

Stay safe, and keep learning!
